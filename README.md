# Raycast
Raycast is FRC team 537's computer vision solution for the 2026 FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) season. It currently allows for the 3D positions of robots to be tracked over time, allowing the robot to make informed decisions around other robots (e.g. pathfinding avoidance, robot shooter targeting, etc). Teams are welcome to use our software so long as follow the attached license. Further, we welcome all contributions to Raycast, and would love to make this a cross-team project.
